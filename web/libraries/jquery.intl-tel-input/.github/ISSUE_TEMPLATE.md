IMPORTANT: please note that the auto-format feature (AKA format-as-you-type) was removed in v8.0.0 - read more here: https://github.com/jackocnr/intl-tel-input/issues/346. Please do not open any new issues about this topic.

IMPORTANT: we use libphonenumber for formatting and validation - if your issue relates to one of these things, please check their test site first and if you see the problem there please file an issue with them instead: https://rawgit.com/googlei18n/libphonenumber/master/javascript/i18n/phonenumbers/demo-compiled.html. Please also check the intl-tel-input validation demo page to make sure it's not a problem with your code: https://intl-tel-input.com/node_modules/intl-tel-input/examples/gen/is-valid-number.html.
