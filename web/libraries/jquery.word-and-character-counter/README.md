JQuery Character and Word counter plugin
=========
This plug-in allows you to count characters or words, up or down. You can set a minimum or maximum goal for the counter to reach. 

  - Create a custom message for your counter's message
  - Force character/word limit on user to prevent typing
  - Works against copy/paster's!

It will insert a <code>div</code> with an id of the name of the <code>input</code> area you are counting, appended with the string "_counter". 
For example, if the input you want to count is called "awesome", the id of the div that keeps track of the count will be "awesome_counter".

Simple? You bet your ass it is.
